# About Wrath Combo

<p> Wrath Combo is a plugin for <a href="https://goatcorp.github.io/" alt="XIVLauncher">XIVLauncher</a>.<br><br>
    It's a heavily enhanced version of the XIVCombo plugin, offering highly 
    customisable features and options to allow users to have their 
    rotations be as complex or simple as possible, even to the point of a single
    button; for PvE, PvP, and more.
    <br><br>
    Wrath Combo is regularly updated to include new features and to keep
    up-to-date with the latest job changes in Final Fantasy XIV.
    <br><br>
    <img src="/res/readme_images/demo.gif" width="450" />
    <br>
    In that clip, the plugin is configured to condense the entire rotation of a 
    job onto a single button, and that button is being pressed repeatedly -
    all actions executed are being shown on a timeline for demonstration.

## Use with Other Plugins

By default, the plugins below will ensure that combos in Wrath are set up, and
will lock all settings under those combos to `On` if combos were not set up, to
ensure that the rotation will run.

### [AutoDuty](https://github.com/ffxivcode/AutoDuty)

Wrath Combo can be used as the Rotation Engine for AutoDuty, such that Wrath Combo's
Auto-Rotation will be used during duties.
To enable this:
1. Open AutoDuty's main window.
2. Go to the "Config" tab.
3. Expand the "Duty Config Settings" section.
4. Enable "Auto Manage Rotation Plugin State".
5. (Also check "> Wrath Config Options <" -> "Auto setup jobs for autorotation")\
   (if you already have your jobs setup, you can skip this step)

### [Questionable](https://git.carvel.li/liza/Questionable)

Wrath Combo can be used as the Combat Module for Questionable, such that Wrath 
Combo's Auto-Rotation will be employed during questing.
To enable this:
1. Open Questionable's Settings window.
2. Go to the "General" tab.
3. Select "Wrath Combo" as the "Preferred Combat Module".
